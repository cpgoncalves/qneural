QNeural is a Python Module for the simulation of quantum artificial neural networks (QuANNs), it includes a library for the simulation of standard quantum computation, using NumPy's matrices and Dirac's notation, and a library for the simulation of quantum artificial neural networks with the ability to simulate and analyze the iterations of QuANNs, calculation of local neuron-level reduced densities for any neuron.

The module is used in the author's research and will include soon added features and examples for the implementation of QuANNs with cloud access to IBM's Quantum Computers.
